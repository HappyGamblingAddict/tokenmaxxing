# @851-labs/tokenmaxxing

CLI for [tokenmaxxing](https://tokenmaxxing.sh) — the social leaderboard
for LLM token usage. Parses your local agent usage (Claude Code, Codex,
OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Hermes, Pi, Grok Build CLI, Antigravity,
ZCode, Amp, Qwen Code, Kimi CLI, Kilo Code, Goose, Droid, Codebuff, OpenClaw)
via [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) and pushes daily
aggregates to your public profile.

## Usage

```bash
npm install -g @851-labs/tokenmaxxing@latest
tokenmaxxing login              # sign in in the browser, approves this device
tokenmaxxing sync               # parse local usage and push it
tokenmaxxing service install    # optional: sync automatically every 5 minutes
tokenmaxxing upgrade            # upgrade the global CLI and refresh the service
```

You can also install globally with `bun add -g --trust @851-labs/tokenmaxxing@latest`,
`pnpm add -g @851-labs/tokenmaxxing@latest`, or
`yarn global add @851-labs/tokenmaxxing@latest`.

The background service uses the global `tokenmaxxing` binary and syncs every
5 minutes. It auto-updates through the package manager that installed the
global binary (bun, npm, pnpm, or yarn) when that package manager can be
detected. Custom log roots (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `HERMES_HOME`,
and the other agents' data-directory variables such as `GROK_HOME` or
`AMP_DATA_DIR`) are captured at `tokenmaxxing service install` or `tokenmaxxing service
repair`; rerun one of those after changing them. Without `HERMES_HOME`, Hermes
usage includes every named profile under `~/.hermes/profiles/`.
Use `tokenmaxxing service status` for the last run and `tokenmaxxing service
doctor` to inspect scheduler files, auth, auto-update, locks, and recent logs.

Run `sync` as often as you like, from as many machines as you like —
profiles aggregate across devices. Useful flags: `--dry-run`,
`--since YYYY-MM-DD`, `--sources claude,codex`, `--json`. `sync` exits
non-zero when no agent's usage could be collected; if only some agents fail,
it still uploads the rest and exits 0 with `"status": "partial"` in `--json`
output.

### What gets uploaded (privacy)

Daily aggregates only: date, model name, agent name, token counts, and the
API-equivalent cost — never prompts, file paths, project names, or session
content. Revoke access anytime with `tokenmaxxing logout` or from
[settings](https://tokenmaxxing.sh/settings).
